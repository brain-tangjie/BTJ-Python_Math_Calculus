Typically, machine learning requires getting a function (a model or hypothesis) to predict future data. Since it is a function, it's nature that calculus is inseparable.  <br></br>
Calculus provides the theoretical basis for our study of the properties and it's also the basis for learning subsequence courses such as probability theory and optimization methods, and it's the cornerstone of the entire advanced mathematics.<br></br>
Emphasis is placed on mastering the laws of derivatives of functions (especially the chain rule), as well as Taylor's formula.
